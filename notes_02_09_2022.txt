class Welcome{} 



We have certain keywords and keywords are
written in smallcase.

* class
* public
* static
* void 


We have classes like:

Welcome ( User defined class)
String  ( Predefined class)
System  ( Predefined class) 

Whenever we write a class, the class name should start with uppercase.
The predefined classes, we cannot write starting it with lowercase which means I 
cannot write string,system but userdefined class I can start with smaillcase, though 
it is not suggested. Which means I can write Welcome or welcome( not prefered ).


public static void main(String args[]){

}
// The above code is a main method where we write some executable line/lines.

System.out.println("Hello Friends");

System is a class , out is an object and println is a method and Hello Friends is 
a string value to be displayed.


class Welcome {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("Hello World! Welcome to Java Programming!");
	}
}
/* String is a class and args is an array of String */

class Welcome {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		system.out.println("Hello World! Welcome to Java Programming!");
	}
}




/* Compilation failed
file.java:3: error: package system does not exist
system.out.println("Hello World! Welcome to Java Programming!");
^
1 error */

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

class Welcome {
	public static void main(String[] strs){
		System.out.print("Hello World! Welcome to Java Programming!");
		System.out.println("Welcome to infosys");
	}
}


Hello World! Welcome to Java Programming!Welcome to infosys.

In the above code the lines are displayed on the same line as with the first System.out.print It will print the information cursor remains in the
same line and the second line information is shown along with the display of the first line.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

class Welcome {
	public static void main(String[] strs){
		System.out.print("Hello World! Welcome to Java Programming!");
		System.out.println("Welcome to infosys");
	}
}

In the above code while displaying the first line, we are using the println method and that is the reason , cursor is
taken to the next line and the second line content is shown in a different line.
---------------------------------
class Welcome {
	public static void main(String[] strs){
		System.out.print("Hello World! Welcome to Java Programming!");
		System.out.println("Welcome to infosys");
	}
}


javac Welcome.java ( We are using the javac compiler to compile the code and we provide the file name, So Welcome.java is the file name.)
[ If we dont have any syntactical error the code will compile and we will get a file called Welcome.class ( This file contains bytecode(bytecode is
an intermediate language between high level language and low level/machine language )

Now if we are doing manually we write
java Welcome ( java is an interpreter which will interpret the bytecode and convert it into the machine level language amd the code will execute)

JDK installations

https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk17-windows
	
https://download.oracle.com/java/17/latest/jdk-17_windows-x64_bin.msi

So first creating an account with Oracle and then we can install.

C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17.0.2 ( After installation with installer it created a folder under Program Files)

We have to set the path for the installation:

Setting the path , 
My PC=====> right click====> advanced system settings=====> enviroment variables====>system variables=====>New====>
Variable_name=====JAVA_HOME
variable_value=====>C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17.0.2 

clicking on OK.

Select Path system variable and edit and new
%JAVA_HOME%\bin

and close the dialog boxes by selecting OK button.





Eclipse installtation

https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/

After downloading and extracting we get a folder with the name eclipse at the place where you have extracted.
click on the eclipse ide application icon to start working in eclipse.

After the installation is complete we click on the eclipse application icon or create a desktop shortcut and started using the Eclipse IDE( Integrated Development Environment through which we can write code, see the compilation error, test the code and execute the code.)

=-------------------------------------------
Create a java project.

Give a name to the project.

Deselect the module checkbox.

It created a project with the name day1.

Right click on the project name, New, Class... assign a class name.


delete the package name. 

Select the main method with the selection of the checkbox.

Click on Finish.


Complete the code by writing

syso and pressing ctrl+spacebar.

It will complete as System.out.println("Hello");


To execute the code.

Right click on the editor===> Run as =====> Java Application
